    "When I first started on this question, I trained a BERT model (because it is generally a 'smarter' model). However, I realized I could not fully interpret **why** the model decided a title was clickbait or not clickbait. Because the question consists of 1) the comparison between both parties and 2) the inspection and explanation of the results, I think the linear regression model fits better because of its interpretability. If the question only consisted of number 1, I might have gone for the BERT model. The results between de BERT model and this model were similar: they differed only 2%.\n",

    "The Democrats from our dataset refer to a clickbait **18.2%** of the time. The Republicans of out dataset refer to a clickbait title **13.6%** of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing how the model came to its results did not directly explain the difference between Democrats and Republicans (beside the fact that Buzzfeed leans towards the left according to Allsides.com). However, when inspecting the titles manually, it became clear that the titles were mostly directed towards the act of voting (like: Everything You Need to Vote - Vote.org). After conducting a short literary analysis, it turns out that older adults and non-Democrats — often Republicans or independents — showed a higher taste for clickbait (Munger et al. (2018)). An explanation for our results would be that the Democrats are aware of this and use this fact strategically, trying to win over swing and even Republican voters.\n",
